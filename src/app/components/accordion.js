    question: "How quickly can I start?",
    answer: "You can start right awayâ€”today even! You can begin making design requests immediately. There's no quicker way to get started on your design projects. Contact me.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the design process work",
    answer:
      "We would first talk about your goal asynchronously or in a meeting. Once we know our clients' objectives we start to work. You will receive a client portal in Notion that will help you follow the whole process and deadlines.",
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly do you work?",
    answer:
      "It depends on the project, most requests are completed in 3-5 business days. For larger projects, it might require a bit more time. We'll provide estimated timelines for each task, keeping you informed along the way.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I'm not satisfied with my design?",
    answer: "No problem! You have unlimited revisions. We'll keep refining the design until it meets your expectations. Your project is important to us, and we're committed to making it perfect.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any refunds if I don't like the service?",
    answer:
      "Unfortunately, refunds are not available. The creative process and research we put in to deliver high-quality results in a short time frame make it challenging to provide uncompensated services.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there any design work you don't cover?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Artentii does not cover the following design work: 3D modeling, document design (medical forms, etc.), extensive print design (magazines, books, etc.).",
  },
  {
    question: "How much do you charge?",
    answer: "Before charging a specific amount we need to know what your project will be about. Right after, you will be sent an invoice with all services offered to achieve your goal.",
